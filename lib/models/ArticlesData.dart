    This incredible trimester lays the groundwork for your baby's development. The fertilized egg implants in the uterus, transforming into an embryo with major organ systems forming by week eight. 

    - **Your Body:**  Expect fatigue, nausea (morning sickness), and breast tenderness. Food aversions and cravings are common. You might experience cramping or pulling sensations due to uterine growth.

    - **Fetal Development:** The embryo rapidly develops, forming a neural tube (which will become the brain and spinal cord), a beating heart, and early versions of all the major organs.

    - **Prenatal Care:** Schedule your first prenatal appointment to confirm pregnancy, discuss health history, and establish a care plan. Prenatal vitamins with folic acid are crucial.

    - **Tips:** Be gentle with yourself. Rest when needed, and focus on healthy eating even if nausea makes it difficult. Explore natural remedies for morning sickness like ginger or acupressure.

Often referred to as the "golden trimester," this period brings relief from many first-trimester discomforts for many women. Increased energy, a lessening of morning sickness, and a visible baby bump are hallmarks of this time.

* **Your Body:** You might experience a newfound glow and increased libido. Your belly will steadily expand, and you may develop stretch marks. Backaches are common due to postural changes.

* **Fetal Development:** The baby's organs continue to mature, and they become more active. You might feel their first movements (quickening) around week 16-20. Amniotic fluid surrounds the baby, providing a protective cushion.

* **Tips:** Enjoy this period of relative ease. Prenatal exercise is excellent for overall health and well-being. Start researching childbirth education classes and birthing options.''',

The home stretch! This trimester is about preparing for birth and welcoming your baby. Your baby will put on most of their weight now and practice breathing and reflexes.

* **Your Body:** As the baby descends, you might experience heartburn, shortness of breath, and frequent urination. Braxton-Hicks contractions (practice contractions) become more noticeable.

* **Fetal Development:** Your baby's lungs are nearing maturity, and they are positioned head-down in most cases for birth. They develop strong sucking reflexes and practice breathing in preparation for life outside the womb.

* **Tips:** Stock up on baby essentials, attend birthing classes, and finalize your birth plan. Listen to your body and rest whenever possible. Savor the anticipation of meeting your miracle!''',
